## About the project

Stampxl is an open-sourced project inspired by Holopin.io where you can collect and trade pixel badge collectibles.
These are distributed through events or as easter-eggs. Some badges are tradeable, which means you can trade with other
users to grow your collection and own badges that you have missed out on.

### Features

- **Create Badges** Organizations, maintainers, and recognized individuals can create badges that they can distribute as
  rewards or as giveaways.
- **Collect Badges** Users can collect badges by reedeming them through claim tokens/links that are distributed by the
  creators.
- **Trade Badges** Users can trade badges with other users, to grow their own collection or get rarer badges to that suits
  their personality.
- **Passwordless Authentication** Experience a seamless login experience with passwordless authentication with passkeys.

Are you now curious with our platform? [Join us now](https://stampxl.shanemaglangit.com/), we're giving away free
early-bird badges for the first 100 users!
